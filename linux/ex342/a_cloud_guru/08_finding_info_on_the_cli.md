# CLI

- Man pages have number associated with them which refers to their category
   - For example 5 means file formats and conventions
   - Or 8 means administrative related
- We can use `-k` with `man` to query man pages
   - For example you could do `man -k rsyslog` and will give you:
   ```
   man -k rsyslog
   rsyslog.conf (5)     - rsyslogd(8) configuration file
   rsyslogd (8)         - reliable and extended syslogd
   ```
