Container Storage Interface
===========================
- To make it possible to work with different Container Runtimes
   - How an Orchestrations solution would communicate with a container runtime
- Same as Container Networking Interface (**CNI**)
- Same as above we also have Container Storage Interface (**CSI**)
   - Not a **K8S** standard
