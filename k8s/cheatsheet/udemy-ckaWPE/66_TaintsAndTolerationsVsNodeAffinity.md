Taints and Tolerations Vs Node Affinity
=======================================

- The destined nodes for pods in taints and tolerations is not guaranteed
- A specific node in node affinity is not guaranteed to be used only for a specific set of pods
- A combination of both can be used to achieve very concrete and restrict rules
