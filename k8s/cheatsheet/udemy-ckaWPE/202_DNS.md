DNS
===

- Can set a *DNS* record in `/etc/hosts`
   - Can be fooled
   - Can get difficult in case the size grows --> HERE COMES **DNS** SERVER; WoooooW
- *DNS* Resolution configuration file on every host located at --> `/etc/resolve.conf`
   - Can add the address for the **DNS** Server
- Local hosts file (`/etc/hosts`) takes precedence over a **DNS** server
   - But this order can be changed in `/etc/nsswitch.conf`, the line `hosts:` can be altered to manipulate the order of **DNS** server and local **DNS** entries
- Multiple entries can be added to the `/etc/resolve.conf` file to leverage multiple **DNS** servers
   - Maybe one for internal, one for external
   - Instead of configuring additional **DNS** Servers on hosts, you can also set it inside the **DNS** server itself

### Domain Names
- `.com`, `.net`, `.edu`, `.org`, `.io` --> **TLD** (Top Level Domains)
- Lets take an example: `www.google.com`
   - `.com`
      - `.` Root --> where everything starts from
      - `.com` --> TLD
      - `google` --> Domain Name
      - `www` --> Subdomain
         - Can be used to further group things, under a domain
         - For example: `mail.google.com`, `maps.google.com`, `www.google.com`, `apps.google.com` and etc..
      - An example on how a DNS name is resolved is:
      ![Domain Names](./images/dns.png)

- `Search` Entry in `/etc/resolve.conf`

### Record Types
- *IP* to *Hostname* is called **A** records
- *IPv6* to *Hostname* is called **AAAA** (quad a) records
- *Name* to another *Name* is called **CNAME** records
   - Aliases

### Some useful points
- `nslookup` doesn't consider the local DNS (`/etc/hosts`) file
- The same is true for `dig`
