   Explanations
   =================



   * ipTables work in layer 3 (OSI), for layer 2 there are other technologies <br>
   such as **ebtables**

   ### Hooks:
      * They can be seen in `/usr/include/linux/netfilter_ipv4.h` file
   ### Chains:
      * represent **Hook** points, in the packet flow.
      * refers to predefined sets of rules associated with each hook point
      * They allow a network admin to decide, where in the packet's delivery path a rule will apply, because certain decisions make point at certain points in processing.
      * Five builtin chains corresponding to 5 hook points
         * PREROUTING: Just before leaving network interface
         * INPUT: Just before delivering to a local process
         * FORWARD: Flows through a gateway computer
         * OUTPUT: Just after generated by a local process
         * POSTROUTING: Just before leaving network interface

      * **Chain's Policy:** When packets reach end of the chain without matching a rule, then rule policy will be applied on them
         * Default chains only have **ACCEPT** and **DROP** rule policeis
            * Default is **ACCEPT**
         * User defined chains can only have **RETURN** chain policy

   ### Packet flows:
      * Examples are given in my *OneNote* --> Please refer to SeDe-->ipTables--> Scenario Examples, tables and chains

   ### Rules:
      **Packet** and **Byte** counter
      * Matches: Extensions can also be added, like for MAC (2nd Layer)
      * Targets: Four Builtin, more can be used or added using extensions
         * ACCEPT
         * DROP: Completely drop
            * Reject: Can be used as an extension, and returns feedback to the sender
         * QUEUE:
            * Allows packets to be diverted to user space for further processing by custom applications
               * *Netfilter queue handler*
            * Often used in scenarios where deep packet inspection is required, such as Network-based Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), etc...
         * RETURN:
            * Terminate the current chain and return control to the calling chain.
